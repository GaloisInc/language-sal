[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benjaminfjones/language-sal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benjaminfjones/language-sal)

About:
------

This package is a SAL [1] model generator in Haskell. The goal is to provide a
concise means of specifying and automatically generating models of discrete
transition systems in SAL.

This is a _very early_ work in progress. Please check back later.

Goals:
------

 * Haskell data types representing arbitrary SAL abstract syntax trees
 * Pretty printer for generating SAL specifications
 * Lightweight language for constructing and composing SAL modules
